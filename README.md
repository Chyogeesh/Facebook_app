# Facebook_app
It is a internship assignment
To create a simple webpage using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack that interacts with the Facebook Graph API, follow these steps. We will create a React frontend that allows Facebook login, fetches user profile information, displays a dropdown of managed pages, and shows insights for the selected page.

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Create a Facebook App
Go to Facebook Developers.
Click on Create App.
Select Other and click Next.
Select Business and click Create App.
2. Enabling User Login
Navigate to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/<app_id>/add/.
Replace <app_id> with your app ID.
Scroll to Facebook Login for Facebook, click Set Up.
In the setup page, add http://localhost:3000 (or your development server URL) to Valid OAuth Redirect URIs and Allowed Domains for the JavaScript SDK.
Save changes.
5. Styling (Optional)
You can add CSS to style the application as needed.

4. Deployment
Deploy to Netlify or Vercel: Follow the respective deployment steps for Netlify or Vercel.
Add Admin: Add aruna.malik.182 as an admin/developer in the FB App roles.
5. Submission
Share Hosted URL: Provide the URL where the project is hosted.
Share GitHub URL: Provide the GitHub repository URL.
This implementation covers the requirements, including Facebook login, fetching user profile, displaying pages managed by the user, and showing page insights. Make sure to handle edge cases and errors gracefully in a real-world application.
